#The support value here and the conference value that you provide a is dependent on two factors.
#1 - the domain expertise
# 2 - experiment you performed

#In Supermarkets there will be separate shelves for separate cost according to its pr
#In Association rules we used Apriori Algorithm which helps to find Similar transactions with “IF Then” rule
#Formula for calculating support is Total No on Transaction with Antecedents and Consequent upon the total number of transactions
#Formula to calculate Lift Ratio is Confidence / Benchmark Confidence
#If we Choose Random Data or there exists data quality issues then the association rules generated with be incorrect
#For generating association rules the two criteria required are support & Confidence
